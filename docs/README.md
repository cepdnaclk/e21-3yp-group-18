## Introduction

Small to medium-scale pet fish vendors face significant challenges in maintaining optimal aquarium conditions due to manual monitoring, lack of automation, and inconsistent maintenance. Poor water quality can lead to fish stress, disease, and financial loss.

This project proposes a **Modular Aquarium Management System** that automates water quality monitoring and control using low-cost sensors and a centralized controller. The system continuously measures key parameters such as temperature, pH, ORP, EC, salinity, and water level, and automatically controls actuators like heaters, filters, and pumps. The modular design allows vendors to scale the system based on tank size and budget, making it suitable for real-world deployment.

## Solution Architecture

The system follows a **centralized control architecture** where an ESP32 microcontroller acts as the main controller. Multiple sensor modules are connected to the controller to collect real-time water quality data. Based on predefined thresholds and control logic, the system automatically operates actuators through relay modules.

Sensor data is processed locally and can be transmitted wirelessly for monitoring and alerts. The modular approach allows individual sensor kits or control units to be added or removed without redesigning the entire system.

**Main architectural components:**
- Sensor Modules (Water Quality Monitoring)
- Central Control Unit (ESP32)
- Actuator Control Unit (Relays)
- Power Management Unit
- Optional User Interface / Dashboard
